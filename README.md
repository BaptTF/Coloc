# Coloc Video Downloader

> A web-based video downloader with VLC integration for seamless video streaming to your media player.

## 🎯 Project Goal

This application solves a common problem: downloading videos from various sources (YouTube, Twitch, direct URLs) and automatically playing them on VLC media player. Instead of manually downloading videos and opening them in VLC, this application:

1. **Downloads videos** from multiple sources using yt-dlp
2. **Manages a queue** of downloads with real-time progress tracking
3. **Automatically plays** completed videos on your VLC media player
4. **Provides a web interface** for easy control from any device on your network

**Perfect for**: Shared living spaces (coloc = French for "roommate"), home media servers, or anyone who wants to queue up videos for playback on a central media player.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎬 **Multi-source Downloads**: YouTube, Twitch, and direct video URLs
- 📋 **Queue Management**: Download multiple videos with automatic processing
- 📡 **Real-time Progress**: WebSocket-based live updates (download progress, queue status)
- 🎮 **VLC Integration**: Secure 4-digit code authentication and automatic playback control
- 🔄 **Retry Failed Downloads**: One-click retry for failed jobs
- ⚡ **Smart Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for unsupported URLs
- 🎯 **Dual Mode**: Download & save or direct streaming to VLC
- 🌐 **Modern Web UI**: Responsive interface accessible from any device
- 🐳 **Docker Ready**: One-command deployment with Docker Compose
- 🔍 **yt-dlp Auto-update**: Automatic updates and version checking

## 🎮 Usage

### Initial Setup
1. **Open the web interface** at `http://localhost:8080`
2. **Configure VLC** by clicking the VLC icon (top-right)
3. **Enter VLC server URL** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8080`)
4. **Request authentication code** - A 4-digit code appears in VLC
5. **Enter the code** to complete authentication

### Downloading Videos
1. **Paste a video URL** in the input field
   - YouTube: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...`
   - Twitch: `https://www.twitch.tv/videos/...`
   - Direct URLs: Any direct video link
2. **Choose download mode**:
   - **📥 Download**: Downloads to server, then plays on VLC (supports seeking)
   - **📺 Stream**: Direct streaming to VLC (faster, no server storage)
3. **Optional**: Enable "AutoPlay" to start playback immediately
4. **Click Submit** to add to queue

### Managing Downloads
- **View Progress**: Real-time updates show download percentage and speed
- **Retry Failed**: Click "🔄 Réessayer" on failed downloads to retry
- **Clear Queue**: Remove completed and failed downloads
- **Multiple Clients**: All connected browsers see the same queue in real-time

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
go test ./internal/... ./pkg/... -v

# Run integration tests (requires running server)
docker compose up -d
go test ./test/... -v -run TestFrontendIntegration
go test ./test/... -v -run TestAPIEndpoints
go test ./test/... -v -run TestWebSocketProgressUpdates
```

## 🐳 Docker Commands

```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f video-server

# Restart
docker compose restart

# Stop and remove
docker compose down

# Rebuild from scratch
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Edit `docker-compose.yml` to customize:

```yaml
environment:
  - LOG_LEVEL=info    # debug, info, warn, error
  - PORT=8080         # HTTP server port
```

### Storage

Videos are stored in `./videos` directory, which is mounted as a Docker volume.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### VLC Connection Issues
- Ensure VLC web interface is enabled and password is set
- Check that VLC is accessible at the configured URL
- Verify firewall isn't blocking the connection

### Download Failures
- Check Docker logs: `docker compose logs video-server`
- Verify the video URL is accessible
- Ensure sufficient disk space in `./videos`

### WebSocket Not Connecting
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify the server is running: `docker compose ps`
- Ensure no proxy is blocking WebSocket connections

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### 🚧 In Progress / Planned Features

#### 1. VLC WebSocket Integration (High Priority)
**Goal**: Real-time bidirectional communication with VLC for better control and error feedback.

**Technical Details**:
- VLC provides a WebSocket endpoint at `/echo`
- Authentication flow:
  1. GET `/wsticket` → Receive challenge token (string)
  2. Connect to WebSocket at `/echo`
  3. Send challenge token for authentication
- **Reference**: [VLC Android Remote Access Server](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-android/-/tree/master/application/remote-access-server/src/main/java/org/videolan/vlc/remoteaccessserver?ref_type=heads)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Real-time playback status (playing, paused, stopped)
- ✅ Live position tracking (current time, duration)
- ✅ Error feedback (codec errors, file not found, network issues)
- ✅ Advanced controls (play, pause, stop, seek, volume)
- ✅ Playlist management
- ✅ Detect when video finishes playing

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add VLC WebSocket client in `internal/vlc/websocket.go`
2. Implement `/wsticket` challenge-response flow
3. Create WebSocket connection manager
4. Parse VLC WebSocket messages (JSON format)
5. Broadcast VLC events to frontend via our WebSocket
6. Add playback controls to UI (play/pause/stop buttons)
7. Show real-time playback progress bar

#### 2. Mobile Application (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Native mobile app to share links directly to the video downloader.

**Features**:
- 📱 Android app (later iOS)
- 🔗 Register as "Share" target for video URLs
- ⚡ One-tap sharing from YouTube, Twitch, browsers
- 🎯 Pre-fills URL in download form
- 📡 Uses same backend API
- 🔔 Push notifications for download completion

**Technical Stack**:
- Flutter or React Native for cross-platform
- Deep linking for URL interception
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Local storage for server configuration

**User Flow**:
1. User sees video in YouTube app
2. Tap "Share" → Select "Coloc Downloader"
3. App opens with URL pre-filled
4. Choose download mode and submit
5. Notification when download completes

#### 3. Additional Future Features
- 🎵 Audio-only download option (extract MP3)
- 📝 Download history with search
- 🏷️ Custom video naming and metadata
- 🗂️ Categories and playlists
- 👥 Multi-user support with authentication
- 📊 Download statistics and analytics
- 🌙 Dark mode theme
- 🔐 HTTPS support with Let's Encrypt
- 🎨 Custom quality selection (1080p, 720p, etc.)
- 📺 Support for more video sources (Vimeo, Dailymotion, etc.)

### ✅ Recently Completed
- **Retry Failed Downloads**: One-click retry button for failed jobs
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages (no more HTTP 500)
- **Jobs Persistence**: Error jobs stay in queue until manually cleared
- **FFmpeg Progress**: Real-time encoding progress for downloaded videos
- **Queue Synchronization**: All clients see same queue state
- **Clear Queue**: Remove completed/failed jobs
- **yt-dlp Auto-update**: Automatic version checking and updates
- **VLC 4-digit Authentication**: Secure code-based auth flow
